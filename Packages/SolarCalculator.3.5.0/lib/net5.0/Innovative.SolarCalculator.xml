            <summary>
            An OLE Automation date is implemented as a floating-point number whose integral component is the number of 
            days before or after midnight, 30 December 1899, and whose fractional component represents the time on that 
            day divided by 24. For example, midnight, 31 December 1899 is represented by 1.0; 6 A.M., 1 January 1900 is 
            represented by 2.25; midnight, 29 December 1899 is represented by -1.0; and 6 A.M., 29 December 1899 is 
            represented by -1.25. The base OLE Automation Date is midnight, 30 December 1899. The minimum OLE Automation 
            date is midnight, 1 January 0100. The maximum OLE Automation Date is the same as DateTime.MaxValue, the last
            moment of 31 December 9999. The ToOADate method throws an OverflowException if the current instance represents 
            a date that is later than MinValue and earlier than midnight on January1, 0100. However, if the value of the 
            current instance is MinValue, the method returns 0.

            The DATEVALUE function converts a date that is stored as text to a serial number that Excel recognizes as a date. 
            For example, the formula = DATEVALUE("1/1/2008") returns 39448, the serial number of the date 1/1/2008.
            Note The serial number returned by the DATEVALUE function can vary from the preceding example, depending 
            on your computer's system date settings.
            The DATEVALUE function is helpful in cases where a worksheet contains dates in a text format that you want 
            to filter, sort, or format as dates, or use in date calculations.

            there are 360° in a circle.) Many astronomers define east longitude as positive. This 
            solar calculator conforms to the international standard, with east longitude positive.

            <summary>
            As light from the sun (or another celestial body) travels from the vacuum of space into Earth's atmosphere, the 
            path of the light is bent due to refraction. This causes stars and planets near the horizon to appear higher in 
            the sky than they actually are, and explains how the sun can still be visible after it has physically passed 
            beyond the horizon at sunset. See also apparent sunrise.
